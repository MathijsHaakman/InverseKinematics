# Inverse kinematics project

This repository is a school project for working with a robot arm. It makes use of the CCD algorithm to calculate the angles of the arm.

## TODO
* Fix bug where the angle of the segment doesn't get calculated in relation to the previous one
* Add constraints to segments
* Add damping to segments
